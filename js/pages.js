    Forms of causal reasoning (reasoning about causes and effects) are extremely common in everyday situations.
    For example, you might use causal reasoning when deciding what to eat (e.g. avoiding certain <strong>foods</strong> you know might <strong>cause</strong> you <strong>stomach pains</strong>).
    Any situation involving reasoning about causes and effects can be represented in what we call a <strong>"causal model"</strong>. 
    <br>
    Causal models are essentially diagramming that allow you to represent objects, events, items of information etc. as‚Äù NODES" <strong>(circles)</strong> 
    and draw arrows between these nodes to represent the relationship between them (e.g. cause and effect). 
    <br>
    For example, if you wanted to represent the following information in a causal model: 
    <br>
</p>
<span style='align-self: center;'><strong>"<u>rain</u> and a <u>sprinkler</u> can both make the <u>grass wet</u>"</strong></span><br>
<p>
    You would first identify your elements of interest (nodes; RAIN, SPRINKLER, WET GRASS) and using arrows represent <strong>RAIN and SPRINKLER</strong> as causes of the effect: <strong>WET GRASS</strong>.                 The causal model would therefore look like the one below:
</p>
<img src='./img/pageOne-graph.png'></img>`;

var causal_models_intro_2 = `
<p>
    Sometimes, you might also want to say whether the cause makes the effect <strong>MORE</strong> or <strong>LESS</strong> likely  e.g. rain makes wet grass MORE likely but if you had another node representing "sunshine" this would make the effect (wet grass) LESS likely.
    <br><br>
    To show this, you can either have a plus (+) or (-) sign next to the arrow to say if the cause makes the effect more likely (+) or less likely (-).
    <br><br>
    This can be shown in the causal model diagram below:

<div class='page-3-upper'>
    <p>
        In today's task, you will first be presented with a set of concepts and asked to draw your own representation of their causal links using a tool called Loopy. 
        Loopy is an online tool that allows you to draw causal models by simply drawing nodes as circles and arrows to show the relation between these. 
        <br>
        Please open Loopy now <strong><u>in a new tab</strong></u> following this link: <a target="_blank" href='https://ncase.me/loopy/v1.1/'>https://ncase.me/loopy/v1.1/</a> so that you can switch back and forth between Loopy and this survey.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Here are how some example structures would look like in Loopy:<br></strong>

    Now open loopy the loopy tab (following this link: <a target="_blank" href='https://ncase.me/loopy/v1.1/'>https://ncase.me/loopy/v1.1/</a>) and keep it open in a separate tab for the duration of this experiment. 
    <br>
    Delete anything on the initial screen using the ERASER tool and replicate each of the above diagrams as best as you can on the same page. 
    <br>
    To draw a node simply use the PENCIL tool to draw a circle. You can rename your node and change its colour using the options on the right hand of the screen. 
    <br>
    To draw an arrow between two nodes simply use the PENCIL tool to draw a line between them. The default arrow will have a "+" sign. However, in real life, causes can have negative effects.
    <br>
    With Loopy, you can use positive ('+' sign next to the arrow) AND negative ('-' sign next to the arrow) links by changing a selected link's type from 'more is more' to 'more is less' in the top right corner of the loopy page.
    <br>
    When you are done drawing each diagram (on the same page), go to the right-hand menu on the Loopy webpage and click "save as link".
    Paste the link in the text entry box below.

    <strong>One last point before you get started! </strong>
    <br>
    Loopy is a versatile tool for causal modelling!
    In real life, effects can be positive and negative but also of different intensities. With Loopy, you can represent stronger effects by adding additional arrows between the nodes.
    <br>    
    To keep our models simple and easy to understand, we wannt to apply the following rule: 
    <ul>
        <li>No arrow from node A to node B means no effect of A on B</li>
        <li>One arrow from node A to node B means a moderate effect of A on B</li>
        <li>Two arrows from node A to node B means a strong effect of A on B</li>

    <strong> Thank you for sharing you models! </strong>
    <br><br>
    With Loopy, you were able to represent causes and effects in a static way. However, in reality, interactions between causes and effects happen over time. 
    <br>
    In the next section, you will be introduced to another way to represent causal dynamics. One that takes time into account. 
    Here we will not ask you to draw the arrows between the variables but instead attempt to understand the which causal model underlies the patterns you observe in a limited amount of time.
    <br>
    The window will be layed out as shown in the picture below. You will have two tools at your disposal to do so:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Interventions</strong>: the three handles on the left will allow you to voluntarily change the value of one of the variables as long as you keep hold of it with your mouse.</li>
        <li><strong>Observations</strong>: the graph on the right will plot the values (i.e. vertical axis is the value) that the three variables took in the last 10 seconds (i.e. horizontal axis is time in seconds), 
            allowing you to observe their variations through time and the result of you interventions. These will be represented by a shading in the graph of variable's colour.</li> 
    </ul>
    The colours of the variables' names always corresponds to their respective colours on the graph.
    The links between variables follow the same logic as what you have done with Loopy. Namely:
    <ul>
        <li>Variables can have multiple causes: changes in A can be caused by changes in B OR C OR B and C</li>
        <li>Variables can have multiple effects: changes in A can cause changes in B OR C OR B and C</li>
        <li>Effects can be <u>positive</u> or <u>negative</u>: more A can mean more B OR more A can mean less B</li>
        <li>Effects can be <u>null</u> (i.e. no arrow), <u>moderate</u> (i.e. one arrow) or <u>strong</u> (i.e. two arrows)</li>
    </ul>
